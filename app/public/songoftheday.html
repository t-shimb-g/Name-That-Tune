                <p class="SOTDCaption">“Hooked on a Feeling” by Blue Swede is a song that we all know and love. But that version of the song, released in the U.S. by the Swedish band in 1974, is actually a cover song. Several years before, in 1968, country and pop singer B.J. Thomas released the original version of the song, which was written by Mark James. For “Hooked on a Feeling,” James pulled inspiration from his childhood sweetheart and penned lyrics revolving around young, and often unrequited, love. The ’68 version also featured the electric sitar played by Reggie Young and produced by Chips Moman. The song peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100.</p>
                <p class="SOTDCaption">The famous ooga-chaka ooga-oogas that you hear at the opening of Blue Swede’s version was a result of a separate cover version of “Hooked on a Feeling.” In 1971, English singer/songwriter Jonathan King recorded his own version of the track and added the famous chant. King was inspired to add the oogas and chakas after listening to Johnny Preston’s 1959 song “Running Bear.” - From <a href="https://americansongwriter.com/the-story-behind-the-one-hit-wonder-hooked-on-a-feeling-by-blue-swede/">American Songwriter</a></p>
